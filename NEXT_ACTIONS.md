# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD Project

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
âœ… ðŸŽ¯ SESSION HANDOFF SUMMARY: Frontend styling issues successfully resolved! âœ… Tailwind v3 restored, app is now visually correct and fully styled. âœ… 131/148 tests passing (17 failing on Quiz/QuizEngine selectors). âœ… Main accomplishments: Fixed blank page, restored Tailwind CSS v3, fixed layout alignment, verified working frontend. ðŸ“‹ Next steps: Address remaining test failures (mainly getByText selectors for quiz options), continue with master plan next phase. Project ready for next developer/AI to continue TDD development. All major frontend issues resolved - app is production-ready visually. (at 2025-06-23T01:12:16.653873)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. **Priority 1**: Fix remaining 17 failing tests (mainly Quiz/QuizEngine test selectors)
2. **Priority 2**: Continue with TDD development workflow following master plan
3. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   cd Contextsystem && python3 update_context.py "description of what you did"
   ```

## TEST FIX RECOMMENDATIONS
ðŸ”§ **Quiz Test Issues**:
- Use exact text patterns: `"A: 3"` instead of `"3"`
- Fix radio button assertions: use proper form elements
- Use `getAllByText()` for multiple elements
- Consider aria-labels for better selectors

## CURRENT PROJECT STATUS
- **Frontend**: âœ… Fully styled and working (Tailwind v3)
- **Tests**: 131/148 passing (88.5% - very good!)
- **Infrastructure**: âœ… All build tools working
- **Next Phase**: Continue TDD development per master plan

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
ðŸ§ª **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
ðŸš¨ **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 update_context.py "what you just did"`

## Test Status Tracking
- **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test` to check current status
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage
- **TDD Cycle**: Always write tests before implementation

## Recovery Instructions
If you're a new AI taking over:
1. Read this file to see what was last done
2. Check current-session.md for full context
3. Continue with TDD workflow
4. **REMEMBER**: Update context after every action!
