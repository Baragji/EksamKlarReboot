# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD V6

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
✅ Created enhanced store architecture with TDD workflow integration (at 2025-01-27T15:30:00.000Z)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS - SESSION 1.2
**Following TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR workflow**

### Current Focus: Enhanced Store Architecture (Session 1.2)
**Objective**: Fix failing tests and complete store integration with proper TDD workflow

### Next TDD Actions:
1. **🔴 RED**: Fix failing store tests
   - Fix OnboardingStore test setup and mocking
   - Fix DataBridgeStore async test handling
   - Fix ExamStore integration test dependencies

2. **🟢 GREEN**: Make all tests pass
   - Implement missing store methods properly
   - Fix store state management
   - Ensure proper cross-store communication

3. **🔵 REFACTOR**: Polish and optimize
   - Clean up store architecture
   - Improve test structure
   - Maintain 100% test coverage

4. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   python3 TDD-ContextSysten/newtdd.py "1.2" "description of what you did"
   ```

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
🧪 **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass  
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
🚨 **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 TDD-ContextSysten/newtdd.py "1.2" "what you just did"`

## Current Test Status
❌ **17 tests failing** - Need immediate attention:
- OnboardingStore navigation tests
- DataBridgeStore processing tests  
- ExamStore integration tests
- Cross-store communication tests

## Session 1.2 Deliverables Status
- ✅ OnboardingStore created
- ✅ DataBridgeStore created  
- ✅ ExamStore enhanced
- ❌ Tests failing - NEEDS FIX
- ❌ Store integration incomplete

## Test Status Tracking
- **Unit Tests**: `npm test` - Currently 17 failing
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage
- **Integration**: Cross-store communication needs work

## Context Last Updated
2025-01-27T15:30:00.000Z - Created enhanced store architecture with TDD workflow integration

## Recovery Instructions for New AIs
1. Check current test status: `npm test`
2. Read this file for context
3. Follow TDD workflow: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
4. Update context after every action
5. Focus on Session 1.2 completion
