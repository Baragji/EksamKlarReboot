[2025-06-23T15:39:45.624229] Fixed StudyPage timer functionality and study session flow - added Start Study Session button, study timer with play/stop/resume, End Session button, and recent session indicator on dashboard. Study progress E2E tests now pass (25/30). Attempted to fix accessibility E2E tests by updating Layout skip link positioning and removing navigation tabindex but tests still failing - skip link not being detected as first focusable element.
[2025-06-23T16:22:38.117188] Fixed TypeScript error by adding @testing-library/jest-dom import to StudyProgressDashboard test file
[2025-06-23T17:10:32.288650] Created MASTER PLAN V3: Premium Excellence Fusion - Comprehensive strategy to combine TDD technical excellence with legacy project's luxury UI/UX design
[2025-06-23T18:42:00.172432] RESET COMPLETED: Project reset to clean state. Ready to implement Kahoot-style design system with TDD methodology. Focus on modern, engaging, gamified UI for young users - think Duolingo/Kahoot energy but professional.
[2025-06-23T18:45:55.631771] KAHOOT DESIGN SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED: Created modern, energetic, gamified design system inspired by Kahoot/Duolingo. Features vibrant colors, large interactive buttons, smooth animations, and engaging UI elements. All 253 tests still passing + 5 new design system tests. Demo page created at root route.
[2025-06-23T19:07:42.214834] CENTRALIZED GAMIFIED DESIGN SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED: Successfully created and implemented a centralized gamified design system to replace luxury design. Key achievements: 1) Renamed from 'Kahoot' to 'Gamified' to avoid trademark issues, 2) Created centralized Layout component with gamified styling (gradient backgrounds, card-based design, hover effects), 3) Implemented gamified-design-system.css with modern, energetic styling, 4) Updated Tailwind config with gamified colors and utilities, 5) Fixed all failing tests - now 264/264 tests passing âœ…, 6) Achieved centralized design management - can now change entire app design from single location (Layout.tsx + CSS file). All pages now automatically use consistent gamified styling without individual modifications needed.
