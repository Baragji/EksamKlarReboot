[2025-06-23T15:39:45.624229] Fixed StudyPage timer functionality and study session flow - added Start Study Session button, study timer with play/stop/resume, End Session button, and recent session indicator on dashboard. Study progress E2E tests now pass (25/30). Attempted to fix accessibility E2E tests by updating Layout skip link positioning and removing navigation tabindex but tests still failing - skip link not being detected as first focusable element.
