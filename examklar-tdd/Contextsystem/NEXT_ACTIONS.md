# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD Project

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
âœ… PHASE 1 WEEK 2 DAY 3-4 COMPLETED: Card and Badge Revolution with gamified styling successfully implemented. Card component: Added gamified variants, interactive states, elevation levels, progress indicators, achievement badges, and comprehensive styling with all subcomponents. All 7 Card tests passing. Badge component: Added gamified variants, sizes, achievement styles, pulse animation, icon support, count display, dot indicator, and outline styles. All 9 Badge tests passing. Enhanced gamified-design-system.css with extensive Card and Badge styling including hover effects, focus states, animations, and responsive design. Created lib/utils.ts for className utility function. Full TDD workflow followed: RED failing tests to GREEN implementation to tests passing. ALL 311 TESTS PASSING! Ready to continue with Phase 1 Week 2 Day 5-7: Advanced UI Components. (at 2025-06-23T20:03:21.111398)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Continue with TDD development workflow
2. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   python3 update_context.py "description of what you did"
   ```

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
ðŸ§ª **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
ðŸš¨ **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 update_context.py "what you just did"`

## Test Status Tracking
- **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test` to check current status
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage
- **TDD Cycle**: Always write tests before implementation

## Recovery Instructions
If you're a new AI taking over:
1. Read this file to see what was last done
2. Check current-session.md for full context
3. Continue with TDD workflow
4. **REMEMBER**: Update context after every action!
