# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD V5

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
✅ TDD Context System V5 REBOOT COMPLETED - Centralized single command system, cleaned up duplicate files, ready for advanced feature implementation following V5 MasterPlan (at 2025-06-23T19:54:23.073023+00:00)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS - V5 MASTERPLAN
**Following V5-MasterPlan.md for advanced feature implementation**

### Current Focus: Gamification & Engagement Engine (Fase 1)
**Objective**: Implement core gamification elements for daily learning motivation

### Next TDD Actions:
1. **🔴 RED**: Write failing tests for streak counter logic
   - Test examStore for streak tracking functionality
   - Test StudyProgressDashboard UI integration

2. **🟢 GREEN**: Implement streak counter feature
   - Add streakCount, longestStreak, lastActivityDate to examStore
   - Update UI to display streak with motivational messaging

3. **🔵 REFACTOR**: Polish and optimize
   - Ensure clean code structure
   - Maintain 100% test coverage

4. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   python3 tdd.py "description of what you did"
   ```

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
🧪 **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass  
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
🚨 **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 tdd.py "what you just did"`
