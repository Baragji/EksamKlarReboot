  "last_action": "CENTRALIZED GAMIFIED DESIGN SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED: Successfully created and implemented a centralized gamified design system to replace luxury design. Key achievements: 1) Renamed from 'Kahoot' to 'Gamified' to avoid trademark issues, 2) Created centralized Layout component with gamified styling (gradient backgrounds, card-based design, hover effects), 3) Implemented gamified-design-system.css with modern, energetic styling, 4) Updated Tailwind config with gamified colors and utilities, 5) Fixed all failing tests - now 264/264 tests passing \u2705, 6) Achieved centralized design management - can now change entire app design from single location (Layout.tsx + CSS file). All pages now automatically use consistent gamified styling without individual modifications needed.",
