# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD Project

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
âœ… CENTRALIZED GAMIFIED DESIGN SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED: Successfully created and implemented a centralized gamified design system to replace luxury design. Key achievements: 1) Renamed from 'Kahoot' to 'Gamified' to avoid trademark issues, 2) Created centralized Layout component with gamified styling (gradient backgrounds, card-based design, hover effects), 3) Implemented gamified-design-system.css with modern, energetic styling, 4) Updated Tailwind config with gamified colors and utilities, 5) Fixed all failing tests - now 264/264 tests passing âœ…, 6) Achieved centralized design management - can now change entire app design from single location (Layout.tsx + CSS file). All pages now automatically use consistent gamified styling without individual modifications needed. (at 2025-06-23T19:07:42.214834)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Continue with TDD development workflow
2. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   python3 update_context.py "description of what you did"
   ```

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
ðŸ§ª **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
ðŸš¨ **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 update_context.py "what you just did"`

## Test Status Tracking
- **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test` to check current status
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage
- **TDD Cycle**: Always write tests before implementation

## Recovery Instructions
If you're a new AI taking over:
1. Read this file to see what was last done
2. Check current-session.md for full context
3. Continue with TDD workflow
4. **REMEMBER**: Update context after every action!
