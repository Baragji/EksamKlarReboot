# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD Project

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
âœ… Fixed StudyPage timer functionality and study session flow - added Start Study Session button, study timer with play/stop/resume, End Session button, and recent session indicator on dashboard. Study progress E2E tests now pass (25/30). Attempted to fix accessibility E2E tests by updating Layout skip link positioning and removing navigation tabindex but tests still failing - skip link not being detected as first focusable element.

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Continue with TDD development workflow
2. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   python3 update_context.py "description of what you did"
   ```

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
ðŸ§ª **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
ðŸš¨ **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 update_context.py "what you just did"`

## Test Status Tracking
- **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test` to check current status
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage
- **TDD Cycle**: Always write tests before implementation

## Recovery Instructions
If you're a new AI taking over:
1. Read this file to see what was last done
2. Check current-session.md for full context
3. Continue with TDD workflow
4. **REMEMBER**: Update context after every action!
