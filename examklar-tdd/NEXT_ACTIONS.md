# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD Project

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
âœ… PHASE 2 Week 3 Day 3-4 COMPLETED: Centralized gamified design system - moved all onboarding styles to central design system, created reusable classes (section-gamified-welcome, animation-fade-in, progress-gamified-indicator, card-gamified-interactive, section-gamified-form, input-gamified-enhanced, alert-gamified-error, section-gamified-celebration), updated Input component with gamified-enhanced variant, ensured all 340 tests passing. All components now automatically inherit gamified styling through centralized system. (at 2025-06-23T21:12:21.670807)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS - PHASE 2 Week 3 Day 5
**Objective**: Onboarding Testing & Polish

### Next TDD Actions:
1. **Write E2E tests for new onboarding flow**
   - Test complete user journey through all 3 steps
   - Verify gamified animations work correctly
   - Test form validation flow

2. **Test animations and transitions**
   - Verify fade-in animations trigger correctly
   - Test slide-in transitions between steps
   - Check celebration animations on completion

3. **Verify form validation and accessibility**
   - Test error states with gamified styling
   - Verify ARIA labels and screen reader support
   - Test keyboard navigation through onboarding

4. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   python3 update_context.py "description of what you did"
   ```

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
ðŸ§ª **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
ðŸš¨ **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 update_context.py "what you just did"`

## Test Status Tracking
- **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test` to check current status
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage
- **TDD Cycle**: Always write tests before implementation

## Recovery Instructions
If you're a new AI taking over:
1. Read this file to see what was last done
2. Check current-session.md for full context
3. Continue with TDD workflow
4. **REMEMBER**: Update context after every action!
