# 🚀 CONDUCTOR 2025 - ROADMAP-AWARE TDD SYSTEM V7

## Overview

An enhanced Test-Driven Development (TDD) system specifically designed for **Conductor 2025 AI RAG Platform**. This system combines strict TDD enforcement with comprehensive roadmap tracking, ensuring both code quality and strategic development progress across our 8-week enterprise transformation journey.

### 🎯 Key Features
- **Roadmap Integration**: Tracks progress across 4 major development phases
- **TDD Enforcement**: Strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle compliance
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains development state across sessions
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors KPIs and success metrics
- **Phase-Aware Guidance**: Provides roadmap-specific next actions

## 🚨 Critical Rules

**AFTER EVERY ACTION YOU TAKE, YOU MUST RUN:**
```bash
# Enhanced roadmap-aware TDD system
python3 roadmap_tdd.py "description of what you just did"

# OR legacy system (still supported)
python3 tdd.py conductor-2025 "description of what you just did"
```

### 🎯 CONDUCTOR 2025 ROADMAP PHASES
```
🏗️ FASE 1: PRODUCTION FOUNDATION     (Week 1-2) - Docker, Qdrant, Config
🧠 FASE 2: ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE     (Week 3-4) - Knowledge Graph, Context
🏢 FASE 3: ENTERPRISE FEATURES       (Week 5-6) - Auth, Security, Monitoring  
⚡ FASE 4: SCALABILITY & PERFORMANCE (Week 7-8) - K8s, Scaling, Optimization
```

### TDD Workflow (STRICTLY ENFORCED)
1. **🔴 RED**: Write a failing test first (with roadmap context)
2. **🟢 GREEN**: Write minimal code to make it pass  
3. **🔵 REFACTOR**: Improve code quality (production-ready)
4. **📊 TRACK**: Monitor roadmap progress and KPIs
5. **REPEAT**: Continue the cycle

## TDD Phase Detection

The system automatically detects your TDD phase based on action descriptions:

### 🔴 RED Phase Keywords
- "failing test", "red phase", "test first"
- "write test", "add test", "create test"
- "test for", "failing"

### 🟢 GREEN Phase Keywords
- "implement", "fix", "make pass"
- "green phase", "code to pass"
- "minimal code", "satisfy test"

### 🔵 REFACTOR Phase Keywords
- "refactor", "optimize", "clean up"
- "improve", "restructure", "polish"
- "enhance"

## Context Files

The system creates a `.tdd/` directory with:

- **`config.json`**: Project configuration and rules
- **`status.json`**: Current TDD phase and statistics
- **`session.md`**: Complete session log
- **`next_actions.md`**: What to do next

### Checking Status
```bash
# View next actions
cat .tdd/next_actions.md

# View current status
cat .tdd/status.json

# View session log
cat .tdd/session.md
```

## TDD Rules Enforcement

### Strict Rules (VIOLATIONS TERMINATE EXECUTION)
- ✅ Must start with RED phase (failing test)
- ✅ GREEN phase must follow RED phase
- ✅ REFACTOR phase must follow GREEN phase
- ✅ No implementation without failing test first
- ✅ Minimum 90% test coverage required

### Error Messages
```bash
🚨 TDD VIOLATION: Must start with RED phase (failing test)
🚨 TDD VIOLATION: GREEN phase must follow RED phase
🚨 TDD VIOLATION: REFACTOR phase must follow GREEN phase
```

## 🚀 Roadmap Workflow Examples

### 🏗️ FASE 1: Starting Docker Integration (Current Priority)
```bash
# 1. Check current roadmap status
python3 roadmap_tdd.py --status

# 2. RED - Write failing infrastructure test
python3 roadmap_tdd.py "RED: Created failing test for Docker compose configuration existence"

# 3. Run tests to confirm failure
poetry run pytest tests/test_production_foundation.py -v

# 4. GREEN - Create basic Docker setup
python3 roadmap_tdd.py "GREEN: Implemented basic Docker compose with Qdrant and Redis services"

# 5. Run tests to confirm pass
poetry run pytest tests/test_production_foundation.py -v

# 6. REFACTOR - Production-ready containers
python3 roadmap_tdd.py "REFACTOR: Enhanced Docker setup with proper volumes, networking, and health checks"

# 7. Mark milestone complete
python3 roadmap_tdd.py --milestone "Docker & Docker Compose setup complete"
```

### 🧠 FASE 2: Knowledge Graph Implementation (Future)
```bash
# When ready for FASE 2
python3 roadmap_tdd.py --phase FASE_2_ADVANCED_INTELLIGENCE

# RED phase for knowledge graph
python3 roadmap_tdd.py "RED: Created failing tests for code relationship extraction"

# GREEN phase
python3 roadmap_tdd.py "GREEN: Implemented basic import dependency analysis"

# REFACTOR phase
python3 roadmap_tdd.py "REFACTOR: Enhanced knowledge graph with multi-hop relationship detection"
```

### 📊 Checking Progress
```bash
# View comprehensive roadmap status
python3 roadmap_tdd.py --status

# Check next recommended actions
python3 roadmap_tdd.py --next

# View detailed progress tracking
cat .tdd/roadmap_progress.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Project not initialized"**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Initialize first
   tdd.py myproject
   ```

2. **"TDD VIOLATION: Must start with RED phase"**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Write a failing test first
   tdd.py myproject "wrote failing test for new feature"
   ```

3. **"Project directory does not exist"**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Create directory or use current
   mkdir myproject
   # OR
   tdd.py .
   ```

### Recovery from Context Loss

1. Check current status:
   ```bash
   cat .tdd/next_actions.md
   ```

2. Review session log:
   ```bash
   cat .tdd/session.md
   ```

3. Continue from last known phase

## Best Practices

### Action Descriptions
- Be specific about what you did
- Use TDD phase keywords for automatic detection
- Include the feature/component being worked on

### Good Examples
```bash
tdd.py myapp "wrote failing test for user authentication middleware"
tdd.py myapp "implemented JWT token validation to pass auth tests"
tdd.py myapp "refactored auth middleware for better error handling"
```

### Bad Examples
```bash
tdd.py myapp "fixed stuff"  # Too vague
tdd.py myapp "added code"   # No TDD context
```

### Testing Strategy
- Run tests after every phase
- Check coverage regularly
- Keep tests focused and specific
- Write tests before implementation
