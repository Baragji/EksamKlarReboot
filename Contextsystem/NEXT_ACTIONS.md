# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD Project

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
✅ 🎯 SESSION HANDOFF SUMMARY: Frontend styling issues successfully resolved! ✅ Tailwind v3 restored, app is now visually correct and fully styled. ✅ 131/148 tests passing (17 failing on Quiz/QuizEngine selectors). ✅ Main accomplishments: Fixed blank page, restored Tailwind CSS v3, fixed layout alignment, verified working frontend. 📋 Next steps: Address remaining test failures (mainly getByText selectors for quiz options), continue with master plan next phase. Project ready for next developer/AI to continue TDD development. All major frontend issues resolved - app is production-ready visually. (at 2025-06-23T01:12:16.653873)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Continue with TDD development workflow
2. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   python3 update_context.py "description of what you did"
   ```

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
🧪 **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
🚨 **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 update_context.py "what you just did"`

## Test Status Tracking
- **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test` to check current status
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage
- **TDD Cycle**: Always write tests before implementation

## Recovery Instructions
If you're a new AI taking over:
1. Read this file to see what was last done
2. Check current-session.md for full context
3. Continue with TDD workflow
4. **REMEMBER**: Update context after every action!
