# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD Project

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
âœ… ðŸ§ª TDD E2E MAJOR SUCCESS: Quiz flow implementation COMPLETE! Fixed QuizPage step-by-step following TDD methodology: 1) Added subject selector with proper data-testid 2) Added question count and difficulty selectors 3) Implemented Start Quiz functionality 4) Added quiz question interface with data-testids 5) Implemented state management for quiz flow (setup -> active -> results -> review) 6) Added Review Answers functionality. THIRD COMPLETE E2E USER JOURNEY NOW WORKING! Total: 14/15 E2E tests passing across three major user journeys (onboarding + flashcard + quiz), only 1 mobile layout issue remaining. Ready for next E2E journey or mobile responsiveness fixes. (at 2025-06-23T13:33:15.766499)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Continue with TDD development workflow
2. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   python3 update_context.py "description of what you did"
   ```

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
ðŸ§ª **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
ðŸš¨ **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 update_context.py "what you just did"`

## Test Status Tracking
- **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test` to check current status
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage
- **TDD Cycle**: Always write tests before implementation

## Recovery Instructions
If you're a new AI taking over:
1. Read this file to see what was last done
2. Check current-session.md for full context
3. Continue with TDD workflow
4. **REMEMBER**: Update context after every action!
