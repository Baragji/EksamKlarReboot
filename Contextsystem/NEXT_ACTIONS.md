# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD Project

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
âœ… ðŸ§ª TDD CYCLE 9 COMPLETE: Study Progress Analytics Dashboard - 196/196 tests passing! Successfully implemented comprehensive study progress dashboard following TDD methodology: RED (8 failing tests) â†’ GREEN (implemented StudyProgressDashboard with analytics, weekly goals, flashcard integration, motivational messages, empty states) â†’ REFACTOR (fixed test selectors, integrated with DashboardPage). Features: study time tracking, session analytics, streak monitoring, weekly progress bars, upcoming exams, flashcard statistics, progress trends placeholder, responsive design. Ready for next TDD cycle or REFACTOR phase: improve dashboard styling, add charts, enhance analytics. (at 2025-06-23T07:31:54.760196)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Continue with TDD development workflow
2. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   python3 update_context.py "description of what you did"
   ```

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
ðŸ§ª **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
ðŸš¨ **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 update_context.py "what you just did"`

## Test Status Tracking
- **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test` to check current status
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage
- **TDD Cycle**: Always write tests before implementation

## Recovery Instructions
If you're a new AI taking over:
1. Read this file to see what was last done
2. Check current-session.md for full context
3. Continue with TDD workflow
4. **REMEMBER**: Update context after every action!
