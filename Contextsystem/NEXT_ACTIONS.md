# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD Project

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
✅ 🧪 TDD CYCLE COMPLETE: Fixed App.tsx routing structure - 73/73 tests passing! Corrected import paths in App.test.tsx and removed duplicate main elements from all page components. Layout component now provides single main role. Proper semantic HTML structure implemented following TDD methodology: RED (failing import/duplicate main tests) → GREEN (fixed imports + page structure) → REFACTOR (clean code). App.tsx and routing system fully working per master plan. (at 2025-06-22T20:57:16.853937)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Continue with TDD development workflow
2. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   python3 update_context.py "description of what you did"
   ```

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
🧪 **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
🚨 **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 update_context.py "what you just did"`

## Test Status Tracking
- **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test` to check current status
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage
- **TDD Cycle**: Always write tests before implementation

## Recovery Instructions
If you're a new AI taking over:
1. Read this file to see what was last done
2. Check current-session.md for full context
3. Continue with TDD workflow
4. **REMEMBER**: Update context after every action!
