# NEXT ACTIONS - ExamKlar TDD Project

## LAST ACTION COMPLETED
âœ… ðŸ§ª TDD E2E PROGRESS UPDATE: Continued systematic E2E fixes following TDD methodology. Added data-testid attributes to StudyProgressDashboard for analytics test but encountering element visibility issues. Dashboard may require onboarding completion or authentication state. Current status: 10 E2E tests passing (2 complete user journeys: onboarding + flashcard creation/study), 25 failing. Need to investigate dashboard page loading requirements or simplify analytics test approach. Following TDD principles: minimal changes, one test at a time. Ready to either debug dashboard analytics or move to next failing test. (at 2025-06-23T13:07:29.609278)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Continue with TDD development workflow
2. **CRITICAL**: After your next action, run:
   ```bash
   python3 update_context.py "description of what you did"
   ```

## TDD WORKFLOW REMINDER
ðŸ§ª **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Refactor to improve code quality
4. Repeat

## MANDATORY RULE FOR ALL AIs
ðŸš¨ **YOU MUST ALWAYS**:
1. After creating/modifying ANY file
2. After running ANY test
3. After ANY significant action
4. Run: `python3 update_context.py "what you just did"`

## Test Status Tracking
- **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test` to check current status
- **Coverage**: Aim for >90% coverage
- **TDD Cycle**: Always write tests before implementation

## Recovery Instructions
If you're a new AI taking over:
1. Read this file to see what was last done
2. Check current-session.md for full context
3. Continue with TDD workflow
4. **REMEMBER**: Update context after every action!
