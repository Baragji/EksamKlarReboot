Added data-testid attributes to StudyProgressDashboard for analytics test but encountering element visibility issues. Dashboard may require onboarding completion or authentication state. Current status: 10 E2E tests passing (2 complete user journeys: onboarding + flashcard creation/study), 25 failing. Need to investigate dashboard page loading requirements or simplify analytics test approach. Following TDD principles: minimal changes, one test at a time. Ready to either debug dashboard analytics or move to next failing test.",
