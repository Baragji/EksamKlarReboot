## Session Started
Session initialized for ExamKlar TDD development
[2025-06-22T19:05:29.468515] Created comprehensive TDD-first master plan and context system - Established bulletproof development methodology with test-driven approach, complete project structure, and quality assurance framework
[2025-06-22T19:30:08.857709] üß™ TDD CYCLE 1 COMPLETE: Created Button component with comprehensive test suite - 9/9 tests passing. Followed RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology: wrote failing tests first, implemented minimal code to pass, now ready for refactor phase
[2025-06-22T19:41:22.963159] üß™ TDD CYCLES 1-2 COMPLETE: Implemented Button component (9/9 tests) and ExamStore with full Zustand state management (10/10 tests). Total 19/19 tests passing with good coverage. TDD methodology working perfectly - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles established
[2025-06-22T19:51:09.754627] üß™ TDD CYCLES 1-3 COMPLETE: Button (9/9), Input (14/14), ExamStore (10/10) - Total 33/33 tests passing! Input component with full validation, accessibility, and error handling. TDD methodology proven with 100% component coverage. Ready for next cycle
[2025-06-22T19:57:55.997304] üß™ TDD CYCLE 4 COMPLETE: SubjectCard component (12/12 tests) - Total 45/45 tests passing! Following master plan Day 3-5 completed. SubjectCard with progress tracking, urgency styling, accessibility, keyboard navigation. Ready for Day 6-7: Routing and Layout TDD
[2025-06-22T20:02:47.976074] üß™ TDD CYCLE 5 - GREEN PHASE: Started implementing App.tsx routing structure and Layout component to pass failing App.test.tsx routing tests. Created Layout component with navigation. Need to complete page components next.
[2025-06-22T20:04:06.783396] STOPPING non-TDD approach - starting proper TDD cycle for page components. Writing tests FIRST before implementation.
[2025-06-22T20:21:04.728928] ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL SUCCESS + 1 BLOCKING ISSUE: Completed TDD cycles for all page components (OnboardingPage, DashboardPage, StudyPage, FlashcardsPage, QuizPage, NotFoundPage) - all 64 individual tests PASS. Layout component created. Only App.test.tsx fails due to import resolution issue with App.tsx - all other routing/page tests work perfectly. Need to fix App.tsx import issue to complete routing TDD cycle. Status: 64/64 individual tests pass, only 1 test suite blocked by import bug.
[2025-06-22T20:57:16.853937] üß™ TDD CYCLE COMPLETE: Fixed App.tsx routing structure - 73/73 tests passing! Corrected import paths in App.test.tsx and removed duplicate main elements from all page components. Layout component now provides single main role. Proper semantic HTML structure implemented following TDD methodology: RED (failing import/duplicate main tests) ‚Üí GREEN (fixed imports + page structure) ‚Üí REFACTOR (clean code). App.tsx and routing system fully working per master plan.
